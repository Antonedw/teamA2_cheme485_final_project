**Topic: Problems at Cumene Production Facility: Unit 800** <br>

We are working on **Project 5**

**Assignments for the Planning Report:**

Planning reports must include:

**1.** A short abstract describing the process. - **Georges**

The Cumene Production Facility buys **propylene** and **benzene** from a manufacturer to produce **cumene** and an undesired product, **p-diisopropyl benzene** (DIPB). The plant goal is to produce **90,000 metric tons per year of 99 wt% purity cumene**. The propylene and the benzene come liquid in the from a manufacturer, and we pump and heat them up to vaporize them since the reaction happens in the **vapor phase**. We will be using cooling water to cool off the product throught a heat exhanger since our reaction is **exothermic**, then the product will be sent into a flash drum. The flash drum will be splitting the product into a gas that will be used for **fuel** for a furnace , and the rest of the liquid will go into a first distillation column. In the first distillation column, we will be separating benzene from the rest of the product. The benzene will be **recycled** and mixed with the manufacturer benzene. The rest of the product from the first distillation column will be sent to a second distillation column. In the second distillation column, cumene will come out from the **distillate** end of the tower with a 99% purity and the waste DIPB will be leaving at the bottom and be used for **fuel** for a furnace. 

**2.** Hand-written block flow diagram of the process. - **Georges**

**3.** Initial data regarding the reaction kinetics necessary for simulations - **Emily**


**4.** A suggested thermodynamics package and any extra information that needs to be gathered for the simulation - **Edwin**

**5.** An order of magnitude estimate of the design cost. - **Bri**
